# Advent of Code 2020

This repository hosts my solutions to the Advent of Code 2020, written in Javascript, as quickly as possible – no ponderation, no introspection, just code, crash and restart. The code is run in the Chrome console – can't be more basic than that.

There are no comments, but it should be self-explanatory. I did make some comments on my (Twitter feed)[https://twitter.com/Kongduino/status/1336226084421943297]. There are plenty of commented-out `console.log()` statements that should explain.
